<h2 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jamsy</h2>

Just a guy who loves turning coffee â˜• into clean code and big ideas into real-world projects.  
When Iâ€™m not debugging, Iâ€™m probably building something new, learning cool tech, or making side-projects come alive.

## Fun Facts

- I love gaming
- I can write code in my sleep (but I donâ€™t recommend it).
- I once fixed a bug by accidentâ€¦ and still donâ€™t know how it worked.
- I love solving problems that I created myself in the first place.
